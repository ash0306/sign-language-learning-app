# Sign Language E-Learning Platform
A Flask-based web application for learning, practicing and assessing the user's sign language skills from beginner level.

## About
THe Sign Language E-Learning Platform is a project that aims to provide users with an easy way to learn the sign language right from the basics. This project also aims to provide an interactive practice as well as assess sections where user can interact with their camera to further enhance their sign language skills. This helps the user to further retain the information that they have learned.

## Features
- Implements a neural network method.
- Implements interactive laerning practices.
- Takes comaparitevely less time.
- Accessible and inclusive UI.

## Requirements
* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
* Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
* Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV is essential for efficient image processing and real-time hand gesture recognition.
* IDE: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.

## Results
The Sign Language E-Learning Platform provides a reliable and accessible way for beginners to learn sign language. This initiative provides a way by which users can learn as well as check their understanding of the sign language. This platform allows users to learn sign language according to their pace and timings. The integration of Deep Learning models provides an accurate avenue to practice and assess the user's sign language skills.

This project serves as a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital learning environment.
